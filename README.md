# Terraform

## Introduction
Infrastructure as code (IaC) tools allow you to manage infrastructure with configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface. IaC allows you to build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share.

Terraform is HashiCorp's infrastructure as code tool. It lets you define resources and infrastructure in human-readable, declarative configuration files, and manages your infrastructure's lifecycle. Using Terraform has several advantages over manually managing your infrastructure:

    Terraform can manage infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms.
    The human-readable configuration language helps you write infrastructure code quickly.
    Terraform's state allows you to track resource changes throughout your deployments.
    You can commit your configurations to version control to safely collaborate on infrastructure
